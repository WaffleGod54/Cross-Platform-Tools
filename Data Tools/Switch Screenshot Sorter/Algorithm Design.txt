#Algorithim
Get the directory location of the nintendo screenshots folder from the user
Validate the location, re-enter location if applicable
Generate a new folder where the program is run from for the sorted data (Sorted Screenshots)

Cycle through the folders looking for files, for each file, do the following:
    1. Tokenize the filename (Break the token with the - character)
        >Datecode
        >IDENTIFIER
	>Path
    2. Add the full filepath of the image to the data structure
    3. Check if a folder for the IDENTIFIER exists in the Sorted Screenshots folder
        If no,
            Generate the folder based on the IDENTIFIER
        Move the file to the IDENTIFIER's folder
